# College Football Schedule Generator - Complete Implementation Plan

## Overview
A single-page web application that generates randomized out-of-conference (OOC) schedules for college football teams based on a CSV input file. The app ensures all scheduling rules are followed and provides clear documentation for users.

## Application Structure

### Page Layout
- **Navigation Bar**: Toggle between "Schedule Generator" and "Rules & Format" tabs
- **Two Main Sections**:
  1. Schedule Generator (main functionality)
  2. Rules & Format (documentation and requirements)

---

## Section 2: Rules & Format Page

### Content Structure

#### 2.1 Scheduling Rules Section

**Title**: "Scheduling Rules"

**Rules List**:
1. **Game Limit**: Each team can play a maximum of 12 games total
2. **No Repeat Matchups**: Teams cannot play the same opponent twice
3. **Weekly Limit**: Teams can only play 1 game per week
4. **Week 0 Preference**: Week 0 should remain empty when possible (optional setting)
5. **Preserve Existing Games**: Never modify cells that already contain team names
6. **Conference Restriction**: Out-of-conference games only - teams cannot play opponents from their own conference
7. **Home/Away Balance**: Each team should have as close to 6 home games as possible
8. **Home/Away Notation**: Away games must be indicated with '@' symbol before opponent name

**Additional Notes**:
- The generator will attempt multiple solutions if initial attempts fail
- All rules are validated before presenting the final schedule
- If a valid schedule cannot be found, specific conflicts will be identified

#### 2.2 CSV Format Requirements

**Title**: "CSV File Format"

**Required Structure**:
```
Column A: Team Name (text)
Column B: Conference (text)
Column C: OOC Games Needed (number)
Columns D-Q: Weeks 0-13 (h/a/empty/opponent)
```

**Column Details**:
- **Column A - Team Name**: Full team name (e.g., "Alabama", "Florida State")
- **Column B - Conference**: Conference abbreviation (e.g., "SEC", "ACC", "B1G", "Big XII")
- **Column C - OOC Games Needed**: Number indicating how many out-of-conference games this team needs (typically 2-5)
- **Columns D through Q - Weekly Schedule**:
  - `h` = Home conference game (do not modify)
  - `a` = Away conference game (do not modify)
  - Empty cell = Available for OOC scheduling
  - Team name = Already scheduled game (do not modify)

**Example CSV Row**:
```
Alabama,SEC,2,,,,,,,,h,a,h,a,,h,h
```
This shows Alabama (SEC) needs 2 OOC games, has conference games in weeks 9-15 with specific home/away designations.

#### 2.3 File Preparation Guidelines

**Title**: "Preparing Your CSV File"

**Steps**:
1. List all teams in Column A
2. Add conference affiliation in Column B
3. Calculate and enter OOC games needed in Column C
4. Mark all conference games with 'h' or 'a' in appropriate week columns
5. Leave cells empty where OOC games can be scheduled
6. Save as CSV (comma-separated or tab-separated)

**Important Notes**:
- Ensure no duplicate team names
- Conference names must be consistent (e.g., always "SEC" not "sec" or "S.E.C.")
- The 'h' and 'a' markers are lowercase
- Do not include header rows

#### 2.4 Algorithm Explanation

**Title**: "How the Generator Works"

**Process Overview**:
1. **Parse & Validate**: Read CSV and verify format correctness
2. **Analyze Constraints**: Calculate available weeks and home/away needs for each team
3. **Sort by Difficulty**: Prioritize teams with fewer scheduling options
4. **Generate Matchups**: Use backtracking algorithm to find valid pairings
5. **Balance Home/Away**: Assign home/away to maintain 6/6 balance
6. **Validate Solution**: Ensure all rules are met
7. **Retry if Needed**: If validation fails, backtrack and try alternative solutions

**Conflict Resolution**:
- If no valid schedule exists, the generator will identify which rules cannot be satisfied
- Common issues include:
  - Too many teams from same conference
  - Insufficient available weeks
  - Impossible home/away balance requirements

#### 2.5 Output Format

**Title**: "Generated Schedule Output"

**In-Browser Display**:
- Color-coded table showing complete schedule
- @ symbol prefixes away opponents
- Statistics summary below table

**CSV Export Format**:
- Same structure as input file
- Empty cells filled with opponent names
- Away games shown as "@OpponentName"
- Conference games remain unchanged
- Can be re-imported for further modifications

#### 2.6 Troubleshooting

**Title**: "Common Issues & Solutions"

**Issue**: "Cannot find valid schedule"
- **Solution**: Check if teams have enough available weeks
- **Solution**: Verify conference distribution allows enough matchups
- **Solution**: Consider enabling Week 0

**Issue**: "Home/away imbalance"
- **Solution**: Some imbalance may be unavoidable due to conference schedule
- **Solution**: Generator aims for closest possible balance

**Issue**: "CSV won't upload"
- **Solution**: Verify file is actual CSV format (not Excel)
- **Solution**: Check for special characters in team names
- **Solution**: Ensure consistent column count across all rows

## Technical Implementation Details

### Technologies
- **Vue.js 3** (CDN version) - Reactive UI framework
- **PapaParse** - CSV parsing library
- **Tailwind CSS** (CDN version) - Utility-first CSS framework
- **No backend required** - Entirely client-side processing

### Core Algorithm Components

#### Scheduling Algorithm (Pseudocode)
```javascript
function generateSchedule(teams, avoidWeek0) {
    // 1. Build team objects with constraints
    teamData = parseAndValidate(teams)
    
    // 2. Sort teams by scheduling difficulty
    sortedTeams = sortByConstraints(teamData)
    
    // 3. Create matchup pairs using backtracking
    schedule = backtrackSchedule(sortedTeams, avoidWeek0)
    
    // 4. Validate complete schedule
    if (validateSchedule(schedule)) {
        return schedule
    } else {
        return retry or report conflicts
    }
}
```

#### Validation Functions
- `validateConferenceRule()` - Ensure no same-conference matchups
- `validateWeekLimit()` - One game per team per week
- `validateGameCount()` - Maximum 12 games per team
- `validateNoDuplicates()` - No repeat opponents
- `validateHomeAwayBalance()` - Check 6/6 target
- `validateExistingGames()` - Preserve pre-filled games

### User Interface States
1. **Initial State**: Upload prompt
2. **File Loaded**: Show options and generate button
3. **Generating**: Progress indicator, disable buttons
4. **Success**: Display schedule, enable export
5. **Error**: Show specific error messages, enable retry

### Error Handling
- File format validation
- Constraint violation detection
- Clear error messaging
- Suggested fixes when possible
- Graceful fallbacks

### Export Functionality
```javascript
function exportToCSV(schedule) {
    // Convert schedule back to CSV format
    // Maintain original structure
    // Add @ for away games
    // Trigger browser download
}
```
